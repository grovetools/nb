# Documentation Task: Introduction to nb

You are an expert technical writer. Based on the project's `README.md` and the overall codebase, write a clear, engaging introduction to `nb`.

**Task:**
1.  Explain what `nb` is: a command-line, workspace-aware note-taking system.
2.  Describe the problem it solves: organizing notes within the context of software projects, especially those with multiple Git branches.
3.  Highlight its key features:
    - Workspace-aware organization (Git, directory, global).
    - Git branch integration.
    - Full-text search with SQLite FTS5.
    - A comprehensive CLI.
    - An interactive TUI for note management (`nb manage`).
    - Seamless editor integrations (Neovim and Obsidian).
    - Tools for data integrity and migration (`nb doctor`, `nb migrate`).
4.  Identify the target audience: developers, technical writers, and anyone who works primarily in the terminal and uses Git.
