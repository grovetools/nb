# Installation

The recommended way to install `grove-notebook` is by using the `grove` meta-CLI, which manages all tools within the Grove ecosystem.

### Prerequisites

You must have the `grove` meta-CLI installed. If you don't, please follow the **[Grove Ecosystem Installation Guide](https://github.com/mattsolo1/grove-meta/blob/main/docs/02-installation.md)** first. This guide also covers essential setup like configuring your `PATH`.

### Install Command

Once the `grove` CLI is set up, you can install `grove-notebook` with a single command:

```bash
grove install nb
```

### Verifying the Installation

To confirm that the tool was installed correctly, you can run its `version` command:

```bash
nb version
```

### Building from Source

For contributors, the recommended way to work with the source code is to clone the entire Grove ecosystem monorepo. Please refer to the **[Building from Source](https://github.com/mattsolo1/grove-meta/blob/main/docs/02-installation.md#3-building-from-source-for-contributors)** section in the main installation guide for details.
